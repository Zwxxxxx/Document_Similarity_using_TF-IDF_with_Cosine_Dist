eb83ae79-78b0-4c60-b3fc-ddcc5ec94125," The genomes of most organisms are based on DNA. Some viruses such as those that cause the flu and HIV, however, have RNA-based genomes instead. In general, viral RNA genomes are much more mutation-prone than those based on DNA. This distinction is important because RNA-based viruses have repeatedly evolved resistance to drugs. Mutation rates in RNA viruses are important because these viruses cause a terrible toll in terms of human death and disease. The flu and HIV, for example, are caused by viruses with RNA-based genomes. The high mutation rate means that they can rapidly evolve resistance to new drugs. Any given population of these viruses is very genetically diverse. This makes it very difficult for scientists to develop vaccines for the flu, for example. Because the influenza virus genome is diverse, scientists must often combine vaccines for several viral strains. And, because the flu virus genome changes constantly, vaccines that are effective during one flu season might be ineffective the next. The higher mutation rates in RNA viruses ensure that they evolve more rapidly and could evolve resistance to drugs more readily than DNA-based viruses. Average mutation rates in RNA viruses are estimated to be about 100 times higher than those for DNA viruses. This rate is especially high because DNA viruses lack the sophisticated DNA repair mechanisms found in human and other animal cells. The enzymes that occur in RNA viruses and participate in copying viral genomes is a key reason for this difference. These enzymes lack the built-in capabilities to recognize DNA damage that enzymes in most organisms have. Another interesting difference between RNA and DNA mutations involves the bases thymine, cytosine and uracil, typically represented as T, C and U in the DNA code. DNA uses thymine, while RNA uses uracil instead. Cytosine can sometimes spontaneously change to uracil. In DNA, this error will be detected because DNA doesn't ordinarily contain uracil; the cell has enzymes that can recognize and fix the substitution. In RNA, however, this kind of error cannot be detected because RNA ordinarily contains both cytosine and uracil bases. So, some mutations are less likely to be recognized and repaired in RNA viruses, and the mutation rate increases. Retroviruses, another class of viruses known for their high mutation rates, are the causes of HIV and other serious diseases. These viruses take their RNA-based genome, use it to make DNA within a host cell and use the new DNA to replicate more viral RNA. This process is error-prone and results in an unusually high mutation rate. HIV, for example, has a mutation rate of 3.4 x 10^-5 errors per base pair each time its genome goes through this process. Retroviruses have higher mutation rates than most other viruses, including other RNA viruses. As a result, it's difficult to develop effective, long-lasting treatments for RNA viral diseases because they develop resistance so rapidly.",RNA Mutation Vs. DNA Mutation,True
5a24d0fd-ab6a-4540-ba39-c7c9a5435221," Chromosomes are the structures that hold the genetic information necessary for the development and function of an organism. Human cells have 23 pairs of chromosomes, for a total of 46. A normal chromosome chart, or karyotype, is a picture that shows all 46 chromosomes arranged in pairs according their size and configuration. To interpret a chromosome chart, experts look for any deviation in the number or structure of the chromosomes. These abnormalities can result in significant mental, physical or clinical disorders. The most severe genetic disorders are caused by the absence of an entire chromosome, or by the presence of an extra chromosome. These numerical abnormalities are readily apparent on a chromosome chart. One of the most well-known chromosome disorder of this type is Down Syndrome, or trisomy 21, which results from the presence of a third copy of the number 21 chromosome. The incidence of trisomy 21 is about 1 in 800 births, and it is the most common genetic cause of mental retardation. Trisomy 18, or Edwards Syndrome, is the second most common disorder caused by an extra chromosome. It results in failure to thrive, heart and kidney problems, and other congenital deformities. The sex chromosomes usually appear in the lower right corner of a chromosome chart. Females have two X chromosomes, and males have an X and a Y chromosome. Sex chromosome abnormalities are easy to identify on a chromosome chart, as they commonly involve a missing chromosome or the presence of an extra chromosome. The most common are XXX, XXY and XYY. Turner Syndrome, in which a female has only one X chromosome, occurs in about 1 in 8,000 newborns and results in short stature and infertility. Males with Klinefelter Syndrome, or XXY, usually appear normal until puberty. As adults they can be identified by physical traits such as small testes, breast enlargement and tall stature. Chromosome charts reveal the deletion and duplication of segments of chromosomes, and experts can identify minute abnormalities. When stained with chemicals, the chromosomes show specific patterns of dark and light bands, making it easier to detect segments that are missing or out of place. Duplication syndromes, in which parts of chromosomes appear in multiple locations, are much less common than deletion syndromes. Both types of anomalies result in a wide variety of specific characteristics including eye defects, heart problems, cleft palate, developmental delay and mental retardation. Structural abnormalities result from the breakage and recombination of part of a chromosome, either within a single chromosome or between two or more different chromosomes. The observation of these rearrangements of genetic material is an important part of interpreting a chromosome chart. Examples of structural abnormalities include translocations, in which one chromosome becomes attached to another, and ring chromosomes, in which the ends of two segments fuse to form a circular structure. Even very small deviations of this type can involve many different genes and can produce severe effects.",How to Interpret a Chromosome Chart,
1bb51e70-2580-422b-a0b4-3d3e2cb0a8ba," A gene is defined as a unit of heredity that is passed along from one generation to the next, according to MedicineNet.com. Genes comprised short sequences of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, and are arranged along chromosomes. Chromosomes are simply long sequences of DNA made up of many genes. Geneticists define ""crossing over"" as a process by which a pair of chromosomes aligns closely to each other and swap segments of DNA-containing genes during replication. Crossing over is also known as genetic recombination. There are two different DNA replication processes that occur in plants and animals. The first, mitosis, occurs when a cell replicates to form two copies of itself. The second replication process is called meiosis and occurs only in the creation of sperm or egg cells. Meiosis starts with one cell containing pairs of chromosomes and ends with two cells containing single copies of each chromosome. When a sperm and an egg combine to form a zygote, as an embryo is called in its early stages, they form chromosome pairs. Crossing over occurs during both mitosis and meiosis, though the frequency is much higher in meiosis, according to Science Gateway. The number of chromosomes an organism has varies among species; humans have 23 pairs, or 46 chromosomes in total. The pairs consist of two copies of each chromosome; however, the copies may not be identical as they often contain different alleles. An allele is an alternative form of a gene, according to Access Science. For example, a DNA segment on each chromosome section may code for eye color, although one chromosome may code for brown eyes and the other for blue eyes. Which eye color is expressed will depend on which gene is dominant. Crossing over occurs most often between different alleles coding for the same gene. Chromosomes normally exist in a compacted, super-coiled state. During mitosis and meiosis, they must be unwound to allow for replication to occur. This happens when enzymes make breaks at several points along the chromosomes, allowing them to unwind and be copied. Following replication, another set of enzymes reattaches the broken fragments of DNA. Chromosome pairs line up in close proximity to one another during these processes. In the unwound and fragmented phase, DNA segments of equal sizes may be swapped and then re-glued, forming a chromosome with a different combination of alleles than it started with, according to Science Gateway. According to the Origins of Sex, the frequency of crossing over within an individual’s genome is not consistent. There are hot spots, so named as they cross over with greater frequency than average, as well as cold spots that rarely recombine. In humans, a difference has also been noted among sexes, with the average male having crossover events approximately 57 times during meiosis, while in females it is estimated to occur 75 times during the same phase. A benefit of crossing over is that it maintains genetic diversity within a population, allowing for millions of different genetic combinations to be passed from parents to offspring. Genetic variability is very important to the long-term survival of a species. Without crossing over, meiosis and mitosis cannot produce the genetic diversity necessary for populations to survive adverse conditions, such as drought or disease.",What Is Crossing Over in Genetics?,
e892ba2d-dba6-480b-b43b-3ac247a55dd2," When genes are expressed into proteins, DNA is first transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA), which is then translated by transfer RNA (tRNA) into a growing chain of amino acids called a polypeptide. Polypeptides are then processed and folded into functional proteins. The complex steps of translation require many different forms of tRNA in order to accommodate the multitudinous variations in the genetic code. There are four nucleotides in DNA: adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine. These nucleotides, also known as bases, are arranged in sets of three called codons. Because there are four amino acids that could comprise each of the three bases in a codon, there are 4^3 = 64 possible codons. Some codons code for the same amino acid, and so the actual number of tRNA molecules needed is less than 64. This redundancy in the genetic code is referred to as ""wobble."" Each codon codes for one amino acid. It is the function of tRNA molecules to translate the genetic code from bases into amino acids. The tRNA molecules accomplish this by binding to a codon on one end of the tRNA and an amino acid on the other end. For this reason, a variety of tRNA molecules are needed in order to accommodate not only the variety of codons but also the different types of amino acids in the body. Humans typically use 20 different amino acids. While most codons code for an amino acid, three specific codons trigger the end of polypeptide synthesis rather than coding for the next amino acid in the growing protein. There are three such codons, called stop codons: UAA, UAG and UGA. Thus, in addition to needing tRNA molecules to pair up with each amino acid, an organism needs other tRNA molecules to pair up with the stop codons. In addition to the 20 standard amino acids, some organisms use additional amino acids. For example, the selenocysteine tRNA has a somewhat different structure than do other tRNAs. Selenocysteine tRNA initially pairs with serine, which is then converted to selenocysteine. Interestingly, UGA (one of the stop codons) codes for selenocysteine and so assistive molecules are needed to avoid halting protein synthesis when the cell's translation machinery reaches the selenocysteine codon.",Why Are There Many Different Types of tRNA Molecules?,

f15371dd-ba87-4930-918d-517892948853," A common type of chemistry experiment called titration determines the concentration of a substance dissolved in a solution. Acid-base titrations, in which an acid and a base neutralize each other, are the most common kind. The point at which all the acid or base in the analyte (the solution being analyzed) has been neutralized is called the equivalence point; depending on the acid or base in the analyte, some titrations will have a second equivalence point as well. You can calculate the pH of the solution at the second equivalence point easily. Determine whether acid or base was present in the analyte, which kind of acid or base was present, and how much of it was present. If you're working on this question for a homework assignment, the information will be given to you. If, on the other hand, you have just done a titration in the lab, you will have collected the information as you performed the titration. Remember that diprotic acids or bases (acids/bases that can donate or accept more than one hydrogen ion) are the kind that will have second equivalence points. Recall also that Ka1 is the equilibrium constant (ratio of products to reactants) for the first proton donation, while Ka2 is the equilibrium constant for the second proton donation. Look up the Ka2 for your acid or base in a reference text or online table (see Resources). Determine the amount of conjugate acid or base in your analyte. This will be equivalent to the amount of acid or base originally present. Multiply the original analyte concentration by its volume. For example, suppose you start out with 40 mL of 1 molar oxalic acid. Convert the concentration to milliliters by dividing by 1000, then multiply this volume by its concentration. This will give you the number of moles of oxalic acid originally present: (40/1000) x 1= 0.04. There are 0.04 moles oxalic acid present. Take the volume of titrant (the chemical you added during the titration) to neutralize the acid or base analyte and add it to the volume of analyte originally present. This will give you your final volume. For example, suppose that to reach second equivalence, 80 mL of 1 molar NaOH was added to 40 mL of 1 molar oxalic acid. The calculation will be 80 mL titrant + 40 mL analyte = 120 mL final volume. Divide the number of moles of acid or base originally present in your analyte by the final volume. This will give you the final concentration of conjugate acid or base. For example, 120 mL was the final volume and 0.04 moles were originally present. Convert mL to liters and divide the number of moles by the number of liters: 120/1000 = 0.12 liters; 0.04 moles/0.12 liters = 0.333 moles per liter. Determine the Kb of the conjugate base (or the Ka if it is a conjugate acid). Remember that the conjugate base is the species formed when you remove all the protons from an acid, while the conjugate acid is the species formed when you donate protons to a base. Consequently, at the 2nd equivalence point, the diprotic acid (oxalic acid, for example) will have been completely deprotonated and its Kb will be equal to 1 x 10^-14/the second Ka for oxalic acid. For a base, the Ka at the second equivalence point will be equal to 1 x 10^-14/the second Kb for the diprotic base. For example, oxalic acid was the analyte. Its Ka is 5.4 x 10^-5. Divide 1 x 10^-14 by 5.4 x 10^-5: (1 x 10^-14)/(5.4 x 10^-5) = 1.852 x 10^-10. This is the Kb for the completely deprotonated form of oxalic acid, the oxalate ion. Set up an equilibrium constant equation in the following form: Kb = ([OH-][conjugate acid])/[conjugate base]. The square braces represent concentration. Substitute x^2 for the two terms on top in the equation and [solve for x](https://sciencing.com/solve-for-x-4670890.html) as shown: Kb = x^2/[conjugate base]. For example, the concentration of sodium oxalate was 0.333 moles/L, and its Kb was 1.852 x 10^-10. When these values are plugged in, it yields the following calculation: 1.852 x 10^-10 = x^2/0.333. Multiply both sides of the equation by 0.333: 0.333 x (1.852 x 10^-10) = x^2; 6.167 x 10^-11 = x^2. Take the square root of both sides to solve for x: (6.167 x 10^-11)^1/2 = x. This yields the following: x = 7.85 x 10^-6. This is the concentration of hydroxide ions in the solution. Convert from concentration of hydroxide ion or hydrogen ion to pH. If you have concentration of hydrogen ion, you just take the negative log to convert to pH. If you have concentration of hydroxide ion, take the negative log then subtract your answer from 14 to find the pH. For example, the concentration found was 7.85 x 10^-6 moles per liter of hydroxide ions: log 7.85 x 10^-6 = -5.105, therefore, -log 7.85 x 10^-6 = 5.105. Subtract your answer from 14. For example, 14 - 5.105 = 8.90. The pH at the second equivalence point is 8.90.",How to Calculate 2nd Equivalence Points,
bee8bfbe-bdcc-42dc-bb7b-7de14dbca475," Carbonic anhydrase is a crucial enzyme that operates in animal cells, plant cells, and in the environment to stabilize carbon dioxide concentrations. Without this enzyme, the conversion from carbon dioxide to bicarbonate, and vice versa, would be extremely slow, and it would be nearly impossible to carry out life processes, such as photosynthesis in plants and people exhaling carbon dioxide during respiration. Although it performs a lot of beneficial functions, it can also damage the human body as well, even causing some forms of cancer. Carbon dioxide is produced as waste from breaking down sugars and fats and in respiration, so it has to be transported through the body to the lungs. Carbonic anhydrase converts CO2 to carbonic acid as it's transported by blood cells, before being converted back to carbon dioxide. As many bodily functions are dependent on a certain pH, carbonic anhydrase adjusts the acidity of the chemical environment to prevent damage to the body. Like animal cells, plant cells transport carbon dioxide gas as bicarbonate before converting it back to use it in photosynthesis to generate nutrition for the plant. One difference is that plant cells obtain carbon dioxide from air and soil instead of producing it. The structure can be almost completely different since it has a different amino acid sequence, and uses a zinc metal ion, which interacts with the oxygen atoms, also in a different mechanism from that of humans and animals. The plant version is found in the liquid part of the cell, while the animal version is found in cell mitochondria. Atmospheric CO2 is taken up in the ocean by carbonic anhydrase and converted to carbonic acid, lowering the overall pH of the ocean over time. As more and more carbon dioxide is released and then removed from the atmosphere, the ocean becomes more acidic, having potential damaging effects for marine life. Marine algae then take up dissolved bicarbonate ions and convert them to carbon dioxide. Although the enzyme is beneficial in many cases, it also catalyzes negative impacts on the body, and a special type of drug, called a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, is available to counter this activity. A disease caused by this enzyme's activity, but not the enzyme itself, is glaucoma, in which pressure from acidic fluid buildup decreases eyesight over time. Some forms of cancer are also accelerated by carbonic anhydrase as well, including ovarian, breast, colon and kidney cancers.",What Are the Functions of Carbonic Anhydrase?,
725052f9-e335-4a74-beb3-a39ad4163858," The world ocean accounts for the majority of Earth’s surface, yet is the least-known of its domains. It's an enormous watery wilderness from which all life emerged, but which is now mostly inhospitable to human beings. It’s no surprise, given it's size, that the marine world encompasses an enormous variety of ecosystems, from vibrant coral reefs and shark-haunted kelp forests, to desolate abyssal plains and gaping submarine canyons. Oceanographers commonly partition the ocean into five zones, which can roughly be divided into three basic realms. The surface realm of the ocean is that is infiltrated -- to ever-lessening degrees with depth -- by sunlight. To a depth of 200 meters (660 feet) is the epipelagic -- sunlight -- zone, which also corresponds to the “photic zone” -- that portion of the ocean where light is sufficient for the process of photosynthesis. From 200 to 1,000 meters (660 to 3,300 feet) is the mesopelagic or twilight zone, which defines the roof of the “aphotic” zone of minimal or absent sunlight. Temperature is variable in the sunlight zone, with convective heat being thoroughly mixed through the influence of wind on the ocean surface. A steep plunge in temperature with depth -- the thermocline -- defines the twilight zone. The huge bathypelagic zone stretches from 1,000 to 4,000 meters (3,300 to 13,100 feet) deep, a reach so black it’s also called the midnight zone. Well beyond the zone of shallow-water mixing, the midnight zone enjoys a constant temperature of about 4 degrees Celsius. The pressure of all that overlying water reaches better than 4,113,000 kilograms of force per square meter (5,850 pounds per square inch) at the lower margin of the midnight zone. The two deepest realms of the ocean are almost unimaginably remote and shrouded. The abyssopelagic zone -- the abyss -- stretches from 4,000 to 6,000 meters (13,100 to 19,700 feet), which brings it down to the ocean floor across much of Earth’s surface. In the submarine trenches, however, the hadalpelagic zone plunges deeper yet -- down to 10,911 meters (35,797 feet) in the Challenger Deep of the Marianas Trench in the western Pacific. Every zone in the ocean harbors life, though its distribution is quite skewed. Shallow coastal waters can be highly productive, inundated as they are with plentiful sunlight that nurtures photosynthetic plants and plankton. By contrast, the ocean floor in the abyssal and trench reaches can seem lifeless, though impressively diverse communities of unique benthic organisms, from huge worms to clams, are associated with hydrothermal vents. Certain creatures regularly cross the thresholds between the ocean’s vertical realms. Organisms from zooplankton to robust predatory squid may daily migrate from dim mesopelagic depths to surface waters for nocturnal feeding. Some specialized marine mammals, such as sperm whales, beaked whales and elephant seals, will dive to great depths. Sperm whales have been recorded at 2,800 meters (9,186 feet) on the hunt for squid and other deep-water prey.",3 Major Ocean Zones,
c75ba6c3-1150-4edf-bc2f-4735d5e405e4," Eels are an order of predatory elongated fish with a fused dorsal fin covering the length of the back. Most eels do not have pectoral or pelvic fins, or if they do, these fins are so small they are not useful. Eels can be found in the top three zones of the ocean: epipelagic, mesopelagic and bathypelagic. Some eels live in freshwater for most of their lives, but they return to the ocean to spawn. The epipelagic zone, or the sunlight zone, is home to the coral reefs. The eels in this zone wait in the nooks in the coral reefs until a fish swims too close to their hiding spots and the eel catches it. Eels are nocturnal, so divers rarely see them in their explorations. The epipelagic zone is home to moray eels, false morays, congers, snake eels and duckbill eels. The mesopelagic zone, or twilight zone, has very little light penetration. The eels in this zone are pelagic fish, meaning that they swim in open waters away from the beach and the bottom of the ocean. The mesopelagic zone is home to snipe eels and longneck eels. The bathypelagic zone, or midnight zone, has no light beyond what the creatures generate. The water pressure is high, but the body shape of the eels makes it possible for some families to withstand the pressure. The bathypelagic zone is home to cutthroat eels, sawtooth eels, swallower eels, gulper eels and monognathid eels. Freshwater eels are born in the shallow waters of the ocean where they float as larvae for more than one year. They migrate to rivers and mature into adult eels in the freshwater. They remain in the freshwater for at least a decade before they return to the ocean to spawn. Electric eels are more closely related to catfish than eels. These false eels are found in the Amazon River and never reside in the ocean.",What Type of Ocean Zone Do Eels Live In?,
72529d8d-ca40-466e-8c8b-987fd2f5eb5e," Living in the quiet solitude and exhilarating landscape of mountainous regions can be a wonderful experience. However, there are many effects that living at high altitudes has on the human body, and while some of the effects are relatively minor, others can be very dangerous. The air at higher altitude regions of the planet contain a much smaller amount of oxygen than sea level regions. This lack of oxygen can have numerous health effects on people who are not yet accustomed to the significant difference in altitude. Different people, however, will notice these effects at different heights. Some people who are young and healthy might not be affected by the altitude and the lack of oxygen until they elevate to around 6,000 feet above sea level, while other people who are ill, suffering from health problems or are out of shape can notice the effects at around 4,000 feet. People living at high altitudes can suffer from altitude sickness. The oxygen content in the air decreases as the altitude increases, and thus people unaccustomed to living at high altitudes generally have trouble breathing and obtaining a sufficient amount of oxygen. For instance, at 14,000 feet a person can only inhale 60 percent of the oxygen in one breath that they would in one breath at sea level. The inability of the body to effectively and efficiently acquire constant supplies of oxygen can cause oxygen deficiency, and exercising or exerting physical activity at high altitudes can further increase the risks of oxygen deficiency. Oxygen deficiency, also referred to as hypoxia, can have detrimental effects on a person's lungs and brain, resulting in ""altitude sickness."" The symptoms of altitude sickness include intense nausea, throbbing headaches or severe weakness of the body. Extreme physical weakness is another effect that can be caused by high altitudes. Muscles in the human body are accustomed to receiving an adequate amount of oxygen at all times, and thus the sudden lack of oxygen associated with mountainous regions can dramatically impair muscles. Free radicals are highly reactive molecules with unpaired electrons, and insufficient supplies of oxygen can enable free radicals to build up and accumulate like toxins within muscle tissue when cellular respiration is inhibited. As a result, people adjusting to living at high altitudes might suffer from severe fatigue in which the body, limbs and muscles become weak and depleted of energy. However, with time the body usually can successfully adapt to the new environment, and the symptoms of physical weakness eventually subside. People not yet adjusted to the mountains commonly notice the impact of dehydration. At high altitudes people exhale and perspire twice as much moisture as they do at sea level. Thus, throughout the day a person at high altitudes loses water at a much quicker rate than his body is used to -- often the total can amount to more than an extra quart a day -- and as a result the body can become dehydrated. People not yet accustomed to high altitudes should drink extra amounts of water to prevent dehydration.",The Effects of Living at High Altitudes,
e337d2a5-7903-4814-abd7-67410269c395," ""Anaerobic"" means ""without oxygen metabolism."" Most multicellular organisms have some cells, such as muscle cells, capable of temporary anaerobic metabolism. Other organisms, the facultative anaerobes, can survive temporarily in an anaerobic environment under special circumstances. True, or obligate anaerobic species must remain in an oxygen-free environment in order to survive. Obligate anaerobes are defined by two main characteristics: They metabolize without oxygen and oxygen is poisonous to them. Oxygen metabolism is a complicated, multiphase process that generates a series of potentially toxic byproducts, including hydrogen peroxide. Aerobic cells have developed many protective adaptations to break these toxins down into harmless end products. Anaerobic species haven't. In the presence of oxygen, they're soon fatally poisoned by these intracellular toxins. Anaerobic species rely on fermentation metabolism. In aerobic cells, glucose is transformed into the primary cellular fuel, adenosine triphosphate or ATP, with the aid of oxygen molecules. Not so in anaerobic species. In anaerobic cells, glucose metabolism stops at the formation of secondary compounds, or fermentation products -- waste products, usually alcohols, that the cells must excrete. Compared to aerobic metabolism, fermentation isn't very efficient -- anaerobic cells only produce two molecules of ATP fuel for every one molecule of ingested glucose, while aerobic cells produce 38. Despite its seeming inefficiency, fermentation metabolism allows anaerobic species to live in some of the most extreme environments on Earth. Each one normally occupies a highly specialized, oxygen-free environment, such as deep ocean water, unexposed soil, or animal intestines. Since their survival and growth depend on the absence of oxygen, they can replicate rapidly when introduced to a stable, oxygen-free environment. Many anaerobic species that are innocuous in their natural habitat become dangerous pathogens when introduced to an unnatural one, such as human tissue. Anaerobic species include methane-producing archaea -- single-celled organisms without nuclei that date back to the origins of life on Earth. Many bacteria are also anaerobic, including the Bacilli group's bacteroides, fusobacterium, clostridium and actinomyces, and the the Cocci group's veillonella and some streptococci. While some normally exist peacefully in soil or animal guts, they thrive in areas of constricted blood and tissue necrosis, where they can produce fatal infections. Anaerobic protozoa include many gastrointestinal parasites and symbiotic gastrointestinal organisms, including ones that allow termites and cattle to digest cellulose. There are even a few anaerobic multicellular animals, members of the phylum Loricifera. First discovered in a deep ocean trench, these minute beings live in ocean sediment, where they conduct their entire lives in the absence of oxygen.",Characteristics of Anaerobic Species,
f4ae8143-b59b-49e4-9df6-3d25701de50c," A singular matrix is a square matrix (one that has a number of rows equal to the number of columns) that has no inverse. That is, if A is a singular matrix, there is no matrix B such that A*B = I, the identity matrix. You check whether a matrix is singular by taking its determinant: if the determinant is zero, the matrix is singular. However, in the real world, especially in statistics, you will find many matrices that are near-singular but not quite singular. For mathematical simplicity, it is often necessary for you to correct the near-singular matrix, making it singular. Write the matrix’s determinant in its mathematical form. The determinant will always be the difference of two numbers, which themselves are products of the numbers in the matrix. For example, if the matrix is row 1: [2.1, 5.9], row 2: [1.1, 3.1], then the determinant is second element of row 1 multiplied by the first element of row 2 subtracted from the quantity that results from multiplying the first element of row 1 by the second element of row 2. That is, the determinant for this matrix is written 2.1_3.1 – 5.9_1.1. Simplify the determinant, writing it as the difference of only two numbers. Perform any multiplication in the mathematical form of the determinant. To make this two terms only, perform the multiplication, yielding 6.51 – 6.49. Round both of the numbers to the same non-prime integer. In the example, both 6 and 7 are possible choices for the rounded number. However, 7 is prime. So, round to 6, giving 6 – 6 = 0, which will allow the matrix to be singular. Equate the first term in the mathematical expression for the determinant to the rounded number and round the numbers in that term so that the equation is true. For the example, you would write 2.1*3.1 = 6. This equation is not true, but you can make it true by rounding 2.1 to 2 and 3.1 to 3. Repeat for the other terms. In the example, you have the term 5.9_1.1 remaining. Thus you would write 5.9_1.1 = 6. This is not true, so you round 5.9 to 6 and 1.1 to 1. Replace the elements in the original matrix with the rounded terms, making a new, singular matrix. For the example, place the rounded numbers in the matrix so that they replace the original terms. The result is the singular matrix row 1: [2, 6], row 2: [1, 3].",How to Correct a Near Singular Matrix,

It helps to already be comfortable solving absolute value equations, but it's okay if you're learning them together too! First of all, an **absolute value inequality** is an inequality that involves an absolute value expression. For example, | 5 + _x_ | − 10 &gt; 6 is an absolute value inequality because it has an inequality sign, &gt;, and an absolute value expression, | 5 + _x_ |. The **steps to solving an absolute value inequality** are much like the steps to solving an absolute value equation: **Step 1:** Isolate the absolute value expression on one side of the inequality. **Step 2:** Solve the positive ""version"" of the inequality. **Step 3:** Solve the negative ""version"" of the inequality by multiplying the quantity on the other side of the inequality by −1 and flipping the inequality sign. That's a lot to take in all at once, so here's an example that will walk you through the steps. Solve the inequality for _x_: | 5 + 5_x_ | − 3 &gt; 2. To do this, get | 5 + 5_x_ | by itself on the left side of the inequality. All you have to do is add 3 to each side: | 5 + 5_x_ | − 3 (+ 3) &gt; 2 (+ 3) | 5 + 5_x_ | &gt; 5. Now there are two ""versions"" of the inequality that we need to solve: the positive ""version"" and the negative ""version."" For this step, we'll assume that things are as they appear: that 5 + 5_x_ &gt; 5. | 5 + 5_x_ | &gt; 5 → 5 + 5_x_ &gt; 5. This is a simple inequality; you just have to solve for _x_ as usual. Subtract 5 from both sides, then divide both sides by 5. 5 + 5_x_ &gt; 5 5 + 5_x_ (− 5) &gt; 5 ( − 5) (subtract five from both sides) 5_x_ &gt; 0 5_x_ (÷ 5) &gt; 0 (÷ 5) (divide both sides by five) _x_ &gt; 0. Not bad! So one possible solution to our inequality is that _x_ &gt; 0. Now, since there are absolute values involved, it's time consider another possibility. To understand this next bit, it helps to remember what absolute value means. **Absolute value** measures a number's distance from zero. Distance is always positive, so 9 is nine units away from zero, but −9 is also nine units away from zero. So | 9 | = 9, but | −9 | = 9 as well. Now back to the problem above. The work above showed that | 5 + 5_x_ | &gt; 5; in other words, the absolute value of ""something"" is greater than five. Now, any positive number bigger than five is going to be further away from zero than five is. So the first option was that ""something,"" 5 + 5_x_, is bigger than 5. That is: 5 + 5_x_ &gt; 5. That's the scenario tackled above, in Step 2. Now think a little further. What else is five units away from zero? Well, negative five is. And anything further along the number line from negative five is going to be even further away from zero. So our ""something"" could be a negative number that's further away from zero than negative five. That means it would be a bigger-sounding number, but technically _less than_ negative five because it's moving in the negative direction on the number line. So our ""something,"" 5 + 5x, could be less than −5. 5 + 5_x_ &lt; −5 The quick way to do this algebraically is to multiply the quantity on the other side of the inequality, 5, by negative one, then flip the inequality sign: | 5 + 5x | &gt; 5 → 5 + 5_x_ &lt; − 5 Then solve as usual. 5 + 5_x_ &lt; -5 5 + 5_x_ ( −5) &lt; −5 ( − 5) (subtract 5 from both sides) 5_x_ &lt; −10 5_x_ (÷ 5) &lt; −10 (÷ 5) _x_ &lt; −2. So the two possible solutions to the inequality are _x_ &gt; 0 or _x_ &lt; −2. Check yourself by plugging in a few possible solutions to make sure the inequality still holds true. There is a scenario where there would be **no solutions to an absolute value inequality**. Since absolute values are always positive, they can't be equal to or less than negative numbers. So | _x_ | &lt; −2 has _no solution_ because the outcome of an absolute value expression has to be positive. To write the solution to our main example in **interval notation**, think about how the solution looks on the number line. Our solution was _x_ &gt; 0 or _x_ &lt; −2. On a number line, that's an open dot at 0, with a line extending out to positive infinity, and an open dot at −2, with a line extending away to negative infinity. These solutions point away from each other, not toward each other, so take each piece separately. For x &gt; 0 on a number line, there's an open dot at zero and then a line extending out to infinity. In interval notation, an open dot is illustrated with parentheses, ( ), and a closed dot, or inequalities with ≥ or ≤, would use brackets, [ ]. So for _x_ &gt; 0, write (0, ∞). The other half, _x_ &lt; −2, on a number line is an open dot at −2 and then an arrow extending all the way to −∞. In interval notation, that's (−∞, −2). ""Or"" in interval notation is the union sign, ∪. So the solution in interval notation is ( −∞, −2) ∪ (0, ∞).",How to Solve Absolute Value Inequalities,
